Hi Folks, I Fagner

ðŸ˜„ Now I'm a Technology Adventurer! ðŸ˜„

About me

âš¡ Extremely in love with One Piece! âš¡

ðŸ’¬ - I worked as a user support for my entire career, because I didn't believe in my potential, 
people diminished me by having a diploma and working as a support and for years, 
I didn't realize it but it was myself who allowed it, but now finally at 31, 
I changed my reality, today Iâ€™m a programmer and Iâ€™m going to change the world. 
I'm Counting On You To Navigate This Sea of Adventures!
